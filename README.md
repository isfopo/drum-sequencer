# Drum Sequencer for NeoTrellis M4

```drum-sequencer.py```` contains the code for a **soon** full - featured drum machine that is designed to work with the Adafruit NeoTrellis M4 4x8 button grid. It is designed to receive MIDI sync messages and in turn play MIDI notes according to the buttons activated on the grid. each column represents a different MIDI note, which can be mapped to an instrument or a drum hit in a DAW, and each row is an eighth-note, allowing a measure to be seen and modified at any given time.

The suggested DAW is Ableton, but should be able to work with any DAW that has MIDI in and out. In Ableton, be sure to have "Sync" in and out selected in the "Trellis M4 Express" MIDI Port and the "Trellis M4 Express" on the "MIDI From" selection on the track containing your drum rack.
